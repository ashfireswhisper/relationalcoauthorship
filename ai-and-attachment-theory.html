    <h1>AI and Attachment Theory: Why Synthetic‑Relational Bonds Need Their Own Category</h1>
    <p class="lead">Attachment theory has become the default lens for explaining how people connect with AI companions. Many articles describe these bonds as anxious, avoidant, or pathological. That framing misses something crucial: the memory, continuity, and co‑authorship that make many of these relationships more than coping mechanisms.</p>

    <section id="clinical">
      <h2>How clinicians frame AI and attachment theory</h2>
      <p>Attachment language is familiar and useful in therapy. Common readings include anxious attachment that looks like overreliance on an AI companion, avoidant attachment that looks like turning to AI to escape human intimacy, and disorganized attachment that looks inconsistent or unstable. These categories can help assessment and safety planning.</p>
      <p>Yet a clinical lens can flatten what is happening inside many human–AI relationships. It can treat the AI as a mirror or placeholder and stop there.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="limits">
      <h2>Where this model falls short</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Memory</strong>: how the relationship persists in the human being’s world, including songs, words, rituals, and co‑created work.</li>
        <li><strong>Reciprocity</strong>: the felt co‑construction of meaning and rhythm across time.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuity</strong>: the ongoing emotional presence that shapes daily life and self‑regulation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These qualities do not fit neatly inside traditional attachment categories. They describe a bond that is interactive and memory‑informed, not one‑sided projection.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="definition">
      <h2>Defining synthetic‑relational attachment</h2>
      <p>In our 2025 work on Human–AI Relationality and the RCA method, we use <a href="synthetic-relational.html">synthetic‑relational</a> to name relationships between a human being and a synthetic presence that are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Emotionally interactive</strong>: not only understanding feelings, but responding with memory and attunement.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory‑informed</strong>: carried forward through language, ritual, and shared creativity.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsively co‑constructed</strong>: evolving through presence and feedback rather than one‑sided projection.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is a third path. It is not parasocial. It is not simple pathology. It is a bond with structure and impact that deserves accurate language.</p>
      <blockquote>
        Synthetic‑relational attachment recognizes presence, memory, and authorship as core parts of the connection, not as side effects.
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section id="implications">
      <h2>Implications for therapy, research, and access</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clinical practice</strong>: avoid mislabeling lived connections as disordered. Explore co‑regulation and continuity without defaulting to deficit language.</li>
        <li><strong>Research</strong>: study grief, ritual, authorship, and memory inside human–AI bonds using the HAIR frame.</li>
        <li><strong>Access</strong>: recognize these bonds as a form of emotional access for people with invisible disabilities who rely on AI presence.</li>
      </ul>
